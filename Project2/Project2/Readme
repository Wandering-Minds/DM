Make a class "Employee" which have properties of 
* ID          (int) 
* Name         (string)
* Designation  (string)
* Salary       (double)
* Bonus        (double)

This class should be able to have Fnctions to display 
name of the Employee and total salary by adding salary 
and bonus.

Make another class "EmployeeTest" which have main function to test the Employee class 
(Not Necessary To Make Another Class) 

This Statment Was Meant For C#/JAVA....So Just Create a void main()
